# Avoiding Vendor Lock-In in AI Procurement for the DoW

**Strategies for ML Platform Independence in Naval AI Systems**

Sam Bright · William Emeny · Alan Jaeger · Adam Larson · JP Lueck · Michael Soltys

GBL Systems Corp. · NSWC Port Hueneme Division

<!--
William opens. Welcome everyone. We're William Emeny and Michael Soltys, and we're here to talk about a problem that affects every naval organization procuring AI and ML systems: vendor lock-in. William will frame the problem — what vendor lock-in is, how it has evolved, and why today's AI systems make it worse. Then Michael will present solutions — policy, technical strategies, and five concrete things you can put into your next solicitation.

# What is Vendor Lock-In?

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8 mt-4">

<div>

### <span style="color: #6b21a8;">Defining the Problem</span>

- Switching costs become so high that an organization is effectively **trapped** with a single provider
- We define it across **four dimensions**: platform, data, model, and expertise dependencies

</div>

<div>

### <span style="color: #6b21a8;">Impact on the DoW</span>

- **Technological sovereignty** — losing control of critical AI capabilities
- **Competition** — sole-source lets vendors increase prices
- **Operational flexibility** — inability to adapt as threats evolve
- **Innovation access** — locked out of better solutions

</div>

</div>

<div class="text-2xl italic text-left mt-6" style="color: #2E7D32; border-left: 4px solid #2E7D32; padding-left: 16px;">
"What begins as a useful tool can become an iron cage of constraint." — Max Weber
</div>

<div class="abs-br m-6 text-sm opacity-50 font-bold">WE</div>

<!--
Let me start by defining what we mean by vendor lock-in in the context of our paper. At its core, it's about switching costs becoming so high that you're effectively trapped. For defense AI, the stakes are uniquely high — we're talking about technological sovereignty, competition for taxpayer dollars, and the ability to adapt our systems as threats change. Weber's iron cage metaphor captures it well: the tools we adopt for capability can become the constraints that limit us.

# The $112 Million Lesson - USDA Case Study (2021)

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8 mt-4">

<div>

### <span style="color: #6b21a8;">What Happened</span>

Paid **$112 million more** for Microsoft Office than Google Workspace — specifically to avoid even *higher* switching costs.

Migrating would have required:
- Retraining thousands of employees
- Converting years of templates and workflows
- Rebuilding integrations with dozens of internal systems

</div>

<div>

### <span style="color: #6b21a8;">Why This Matters for Defense AI</span>

- This was commodity office software
- Not <span style="background-color: #ffe4e1; padding: 2px 6px; border-radius: 3px;">mission-critical AI</span>

For defense AI — classified data, mission-critical uptime, proprietary model weights, security requirements — switching barriers are **orders of magnitude** greater.

</div>

</div>

<div class="text-2xl italic text-left mt-6" style="color: #2E7D32; border-left: 4px solid #2E7D32; padding-left: 16px;">
If commodity software costs $112M to escape, what does defense AI lock-in cost?
</div>

<div class="abs-br m-6 text-sm opacity-50 font-bold">WE</div>

<!--
This is the case study that makes the risk concrete. The USDA — a civilian agency dealing with commodity office software — found that switching would cost MORE than the $112 million premium they were already paying. Retraining, converting workflows, rebuilding integrations. And that's just email and documents. Now imagine defense AI systems with classified training data, real-time inference for weapon systems, and FedRAMP security controls. The switching costs are orders of magnitude higher.

# Historical Context: Lock-In Through the Decades

How Has Lock-In Presented Itself in Past Architectures?

- <strong style="color: #6b21a8;">1960s–80s: Mainframe era</strong> — IBM's proprietary hardware and software created total dependency; migrating off a mainframe meant rebuilding everything from scratch

- <strong style="color: #6b21a8;">1990s: Client-server</strong> — Microsoft and Oracle established dominance through proprietary protocols, file formats, and database engines that resisted interoperability

- <strong style="color: #6b21a8;">2000s: Enterprise software</strong> — ERP and CRM vendors (SAP, Salesforce) created lock-in through deeply customized implementations and proprietary data models

- <strong style="color: #6b21a8;">2010s: Cloud computing</strong> — Lock-in came not from generic services (Linux VMs, object storage) but from *managed services* like AWS Lambda and Azure Functions — convenient, but dangerous to build around

<div class="text-2xl italic text-left mt-4" style="color: #2E7D32; border-left: 4px solid #2E7D32; padding-left: 16px;">
Each technology wave created new opportunities for vendors to establish proprietary dominance
</div>

<div class="abs-br m-6 text-sm opacity-50 font-bold">WE</div>

<!--
Vendor lock-in isn't new — it has been a recurring pattern across every major technology transition. In the mainframe era, you were locked to IBM's hardware and software. Client-server brought Microsoft and Oracle dominance through proprietary protocols. Enterprise software like SAP created lock-in through deep customization. Cloud computing repeated the pattern — but here's a key insight: lock-in is a spectrum, not binary. In web design there's a concept called "stickiness" — pages designed to keep users coming back. Managed cloud services are sticky in the negative, spiderweb sense. Running your application as a container on an EC2 instance? No big deal to migrate. Building your application around Azure Functions? Good luck shifting that to Google Cloud. Generic services like Linux VMs and object storage are low on the lock-in spectrum; managed services like Lambda and Azure Functions are high. The question is: where does AI fall on that spectrum?
-->

# What Does Lock-In Look Like Today?

Key Vulnerabilities in Modern AI Architectures

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mt-4">

<div>

### <span style="color: #6b21a8;">Deeper Than Before</span>

- AI creates dependencies beyond software interfaces — into **intellectual property and algorithmic competence**
- Models trained on proprietary platforms can become **inseparable** from their training environments
- Vendor-specific optimization means performance degrades on migration

</div>

<div>

### <span style="color: #6b21a8;">The Cloud AI Ecosystem Trap</span>

- **AWS**: Bedrock, SageMaker, Rekognition
- **Azure**: OpenAI Service, Azure ML, Cognitive Services
- **Google**: Vertex AI, AutoML, specialized NLP APIs
- Each integrates seamlessly *within* its ecosystem while creating friction for cross-platform migration

</div>

</div>

<div class="bg-blue-100 dark:bg-blue-900 p-4 rounded mt-4 text-center text-xl">
Unlike previous waves, AI lock-in extends into models themselves — not just infrastructure
</div>

<div class="abs-br m-6 text-sm opacity-50 font-bold">WE</div>

<!--
Continuing the spectrum idea: what makes AI lock-in fundamentally different is that it pushes you toward the sticky end at every stage of the development process — not just deployment. Previous lock-in was about interfaces, APIs, file formats — things you encountered at the infrastructure layer. AI lock-in goes deeper, into the models themselves — into intellectual property and algorithmic competence. A model trained on a proprietary platform may literally not work the same way when you move it. And lock-in accumulates across the entire pipeline: you pick a vendor's data storage, then their training environment, then their serving infrastructure, then their monitoring tools. Each choice is individually reasonable, but collectively they move you further along the lock-in spectrum until switching becomes prohibitively expensive. Every major cloud provider has built comprehensive AI ecosystems designed to work beautifully together — but only within their own platform.

# Four Types of AI Vendor Lock-In

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 mt-6">

<div class="border-2 border-blue-500 p-4 rounded">

### <span style="color: #6b21a8;">Platform Lock-In</span>

Training, inference, and deployment tied to a specific cloud ecosystem (Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock/SageMaker, Google Vertex AI)

</div>

<div class="border-2 border-yellow-500 p-4 rounded">

### <span style="color: #6b21a8;">Data Lock-In</span>

Training datasets and preprocessing pipelines optimized for vendor-specific formats and storage systems

</div>

<div class="border-2 border-green-500 p-4 rounded">

### <span style="color: #6b21a8;">Model Lock-In</span>

Models dependent on proprietary frameworks, custom accelerators, or vendor-specific optimization libraries

</div>

<div class="border-2 border-red-500 p-4 rounded">

### <span style="color: #6b21a8;">Expertise Lock-In</span>

Teams specialized in vendor-specific tools and APIs; organizational inertia reinforces the relationship

</div>

</div>

<div class="bg-blue-100 dark:bg-blue-900 p-4 rounded mt-4 text-center text-xl">
These four types compound each other — together, they create lock-in
</div>

<div class="abs-br m-6 text-sm opacity-50 font-bold">WE</div>

<!--
In our paper we identify four distinct types of AI vendor lock-in, and they compound each other. Platform lock-in is the most visible — your whole pipeline depends on one cloud. Data lock-in is often more insidious — your training data is structured around vendor-specific storage. Model lock-in means your trained models can't easily move. And expertise lock-in means your people only know one vendor's tools. Each alone creates friction; together, they create a trap. I'll now hand it over to Michael to discuss the solutions.

# Defense-Specific Risks

## <span style="color: #6b21a8;">Why the DoW Is Uniquely Vulnerable</span>

- **Classification constraints** limit ability to evaluate alternatives
- **Clearance requirements** restrict the vendor pool
- **Mission-critical reliability** makes organizations risk-averse to platform changes
- **Long procurement cycles** (2–5 years) lock in choices made years earlier
- **Trust inertia** — users develop confidence in a model's specific behaviors and "quirks" that doesn't transfer to new systems

<div class="bg-blue-100 dark:bg-blue-900 p-4 rounded mt-4">

**DoW Open Source Software memo (Jan 2022):** Lock-in can occur *even with open source* through expertise dependencies and specialized implementations.

</div>

<div class="text-xl font-bold text-center mt-4 text-green-600">
Good news: CDAO has already proven vendor-agnostic approaches work at DoW scale
</div>

<div class="abs-br m-6 text-sm opacity-50 font-bold">WE</div>

<!--
The defense environment makes all four types of lock-in worse. Classification limits your ability to evaluate alternatives. Clearances shrink the vendor pool. Mission-critical reliability makes everyone risk-averse. And long procurement cycles mean decisions made years ago still constrain you today. Even the DoW's own open source memo acknowledges that lock-in can happen with open-source software.

But there is good news. The Chief Digital and AI Office proved this is solvable with their Global Information Dominance Experiments — GIDE. CDAO built vendor-agnostic data integration layers that work across all operational systems regardless of platform, pulling from over 50 different data sources through standardized interfaces. Their architecture uses open standard APIs for data ingestion, containerized processing pipelines that run across different cloud providers, and open output formats consumable by multiple tools. The results: 99.5% availability across multiple vendor environments, processing latencies within tactical decision-making bounds, and improved cost efficiency through competitive sourcing. GIDE proves that vendor independence does not mean compromising operational effectiveness.

And with that, I'll hand it over to Michael to discuss the policy mandates and technical solutions.

# Policy Mandate: Sec Hegseth Acquisition Reforms

November 7, 2025 — Secretary Hegseth, National War College

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8 mt-4">

<div>

### <span style="color: #6b21a8;">Four Core Contractor Requirements</span>

1. Accept risk and invest in capacity
2. Embrace commercial "85% solutions"
3. **Supply chain resilience** ← <span style="background-color: #ffe4e1; padding: 2px 6px; border-radius: 3px;">DUAL-SOURCE MANDATE</span>
4. Performance-based contracting

</div>

<div>

### <span style="color: #6b21a8;">Structural Changes</span>

- Portfolio Acquisition Executives (PAEs) replace Program Executive Offices
- Compensation tied to delivery speed and competition
- "Speed to delivery" as organizing principle
- Lock-in avoidance: *best practice* → **mandatory policy**

</div>

</div>

<div class="text-2xl italic text-left mt-6" style="color: #2E7D32; border-left: 4px solid #2E7D32; padding-left: 16px;">
"Maintain at least two qualified sources for critical program content" — Secretary Hegseth
</div>

<div class="abs-br m-6 text-sm opacity-50 font-bold">MS</div>

<!--
Thanks William. So now that we understand the problem, what's being done about it? In November 2025, Secretary Hegseth made vendor lock-in avoidance a mandatory structural requirement — not just a nice-to-have. The key is requirement number three: maintain at least two qualified sources for critical program content. The new PAE structure ties executive compensation to competition and speed. This means the strategies I'm about to discuss aren't optional — they're what the policy now demands.

# Technical Strategies for Platform Independence

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4 mt-6">

<div class="border-2 border-blue-500 p-4 rounded">

### <span style="color: #6b21a8;">Containerization</span>

- OCI-compliant containers + Kubernetes
- Portable ML environments
- Kubeflow for vendor-neutral workflows
- Standardized GPU management

</div>

<div class="border-2 border-yellow-500 p-4 rounded">

### <span style="color: #6b21a8;">Open Standards</span>

- **ONNX** — universal model format (1,700+ tools)
- **MLflow** — experiment tracking (800+ contributors)
- **Apache Iceberg** — vendor-neutral data lakes

</div>

<div class="border-2 border-green-500 p-4 rounded">

### <span style="color: #6b21a8;">Infrastructure-as-Code</span>

- **Terraform** — deploy to AWS, Azure, GCP, or on-prem
- **JWCC** — multi-vendor cloud within DoW
- **REST + OpenAPI** — swap backends freely

</div>

</div>

<div class="bg-blue-100 dark:bg-blue-900 p-4 rounded mt-6 text-center text-xl">
These are mature, production-ready technologies — not research projects
</div>

<div class="abs-br m-6 text-sm opacity-50 font-bold">MS</div>

<!--
Here are the technical building blocks. OCI — the Open Container Initiative — is an open standard under the Linux Foundation that defines how container images are built and run. It means you're not tied to Docker specifically; any OCI-compliant runtime (Docker, Podman, containerd) will run the same image. OCI-compliant containers running on Kubernetes give you portable ML environments. Train on one platform, deploy on another. 

And Kubernetes itself is a great example of the open-standards approach we're advocating: Google developed it internally as "Borg," then open-sourced it in 2014 and donated it to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Today AWS, Azure, and Google all offer managed Kubernetes — EKS, AKS, GKE — but because the core is open source and CNCF-governed, your workloads are portable across all of them. No single vendor controls the project. 

ONNX — Open Neural Network Exchange — was originally developed by Facebook and Microsoft in 2017 and is now governed by the Linux Foundation. It provides a universal model format so your trained models aren't locked to PyTorch or TensorFlow. It's bidirectional: you can export from PyTorch to ONNX and convert back using tools like onnx2torch, so it's a true interchange standard, not just an archive format.

KEY POINT — Why ONNX matters so much: A trained model is far more than just weights. It includes the computation graph (how layers connect and in what order), operator implementations (vendor-specific math optimizations like NVIDIA's cuDNN kernels), preprocessing/postprocessing pipelines (tokenizers, normalization), and custom operators (proprietary layers compiled as code, not just numbers). When you save a PyTorch model with torch.save(), you're serializing Python objects that depend on PyTorch's class hierarchy — it's a snapshot of a running program, not a portable data file. A model file without its framework context is like a Word document without Microsoft Office: the data is there, but the instructions for interpreting it are vendor-specific. ONNX solves this by defining a framework-neutral graph representation that captures both the structure and the weights in an open format any compliant runtime can execute.

MLflow handles experiment tracking without vendor tie-in. Apache Iceberg gives you vendor-neutral data lakes. Terraform lets you define your infrastructure once and deploy it anywhere. These aren't exotic — they're mature, production-ready technologies.

ANTICIPATED Q&A — "If AI coding assistants can refactor an entire AWS stack to Azure in a day, why bother with Terraform?"
Great question. Three reasons. First, AI-assisted refactoring still needs a well-structured starting point — Terraform and IaC give you that declarative, diffable, reviewable structure that an AI tool can reason about. A tangled mess of CloudFormation scripts is harder for a human or an AI to migrate. Second, AI assistants reduce the cost of switching but don't eliminate the need to plan for it — you still need portable data formats, model export rights, and contractual exit provisions that no amount of code refactoring can solve. Third, and most importantly, AI coding tools actually strengthen the case for open standards: Terraform, ONNX, and containerization give AI assistants a common vocabulary to translate between platforms. The combination of open standards plus AI-assisted migration is more powerful than either alone.

# Procurement Strategies

## <span style="color: #6b21a8;">Contracts Must Enable Technical Independence</span>

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4 mt-6">

<div class="border-2 border-blue-500 p-4 rounded">

### <span style="color: #6b21a8;">Performance-Based</span>

- Define success by accuracy, availability, effectiveness
- Include portability in SLAs

Technical strategies only work if contracts support them
</div>

<div class="abs-br m-6 text-sm opacity-50 font-bold">MS</div>

<!--
The technical strategies only work if your contracts support them. Modular contracting breaks big AI projects into pieces — so you're not locked into one vendor for the whole thing. Data rights are critical — you MUST retain unlimited rights to training data, model weights, and source code. And performance-based contracting focuses on outcomes — accuracy and availability — not on which vendor's platform you use.

# Five Things to Require in Your Next AI Solicitation

<!--
This is the slide I want you to remember. If you take nothing else away from this talk, put these five requirements into your next AI solicitation.
-->

<div class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-3 py-1 mb-2">
<strong>1. Containerized Delivery</strong> — OCI-compliant containers on any Kubernetes cluster, not tied to one cloud
</div>

<div class="border-l-4 border-yellow-500 pl-3 py-1 mb-2">
<strong>2. Open Model Formats</strong> — ONNX or equivalent, so models run on alternative inference engines
</div>

<div class="border-l-4 border-green-500 pl-3 py-1 mb-2">
<strong>3. Government Data Rights</strong> — Unlimited rights to training data, model weights, and source code

### <span style="color: #6b21a8;">Navy AI Modernization</span>

- **"Buy operational outcomes, not AI"**
- Performance-based contracts with portability
- Robust follow-on competition maintained

</div>

</div>

<div class="abs-br m-6 text-sm opacity-50 font-bold">MS</div>

<!--
These aren't hypothetical strategies — they're working in production today. The CDAO's GIDE program integrates data from over 50 sources using vendor-agnostic layers, achieving 99.5% availability. The Army runs a true multi-cloud strategy across all three major providers. And the Navy's approach of buying outcomes rather than platforms has kept follow-on competition robust.

GIDE background: Originally created by NORTHCOM in 2020, handed to CDAO in 2022. Runs on 90-day cycles — each iteration incrementally tests, measures, and fields solutions on live operational networks. Software engineers sit directly beside warfighters at combatant commands getting real-time feedback. GIDE 9 (early 2024) was the first to demonstrate a completely vendor-agnostic data integration layer. CDAO leveraged $100M in FY24-25 for GenAI pilots integrated into GIDE. The AI Rapid Capabilities Cell (launched Dec 2024) now uses GIDE to test frontier AI models with warfighters.

Timely example: The recent Anthropic/Pentagon dispute (Feb 2026) — where Claude was designated a supply chain risk and all defense contractors were ordered to cease commercial activity with Anthropic — is a real-world proof point. Organizations running GIDE-style vendor-agnostic architectures can swap out an AI provider with minimal disruption, while those locked in face a 6-month scramble. This is exactly why vendor-agnostic design matters.
